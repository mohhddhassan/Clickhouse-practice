Task 2: Create a Role (analyst_readonly) and Assign It to Multiple Users

1. As an admin, create a reusable role named analyst_readonly.

2. Grant this role read-only access to one or more databases.

3. Create two or more users to represent data analysts.

4. Assign the newly created role to each of these users.

5. Validate that all users assigned this role can perform SELECT operations but cannot modify data.

6. Check the privilege inheritance by viewing the assigned roles for each user.	

7. Record observations about how role-based permissions simplify multi-user access management.
